# Rules regarding **Perpetual Check** (*Chang Jiang*) and **Perpetual Chase** (*Chang Zhuo*) in Xiangqi (Chinese Chess)

In Xiangqi, unlike Western Chess where 3-fold repetition is an automatic draw, the rules are much stricter for the attacker. The general principle is: **"Perpetual Check is forbidden, Perpetual Chase is usually forbidden."**

If a player violates these rules and refuses to change their move, they will be judged as **losing the game**.

## 1. The Core Principles

* **The Attacker Must Change:** If one side is continuously attacking (checking or chasing an unprotected piece), that side is responsible for changing the move.
* **Mutual Repetition = Draw:** If both sides are violating rules (e.g., both are chasing each other) or both are making "idle" moves without attacking, it is declared a Draw.

---

## 2. Perpetual Check (Chang Jiang)

* **Definition:** One player continuously attacks the opponent’s General (King) in consecutive moves, putting them in "Check."
* **The Rule:** **Strictly Forbidden.**
* **Outcome:** The player delivering the checks **must stop**. If they persist (e.g., repeating the position 3 times), the referee will declare them the **loser**.
* **Note:** Even if you are checking to save yourself from checkmate ("Checking to Break a Kill"), you are generally not allowed to do this perpetually. You must find another way or resign.

## 3. Perpetual Chase (Chang Zhuo)

* **Definition:** One player continuously chases an opponent's piece (other than the General) with the intent to capture it.
* **The Rule:** It depends on whether the target piece is "Rooted" (Protected) or "Rootless" (Unprotected).

### A. Chasing a "Rootless" Piece (Forbidden)

If you are chasing a piece that has **no protection** (or has a "False Root"), you are threatening to win material for free.

* **Verdict:** You are **Forbidden** from doing this perpetually. You must change your move, or you lose.

### B. Chasing a "Rooted" Piece (Allowed)

If you are chasing a piece that is **protected by a "True Root"** (meaning if you capture it, the opponent can immediately capture you back), this is considered an offer to trade.

* **Verdict:** You are **Allowed** to continue. If the opponent does not want to trade, *they* must move their piece away or change their strategy.

## 4. The Critical Concept: True vs. False Roots

This is the most technical part of the rule, often deciding the game.

* **True Root (Effective Protection):**
The protecting piece guards the target and is **free to move**. If a capture happens, the protector can physically recapture.
* *Rule:* Chasing a piece with a True Root is **Allowed**.


* **False Root (Ineffective Protection):**
The piece *looks* protected, but the protector is **pinned**. For example, if the protector moves to recapture, it would expose the General to a Check (from a Chariot or Cannon). Therefore, the protector cannot actually move.
* *Rule:* Chasing a piece with a False Root is treated as chasing an unprotected piece. It is **Forbidden** (Attacker loses if they don't stop).

## 5. Complex Scenarios ("One... One...")

Players sometimes mix moves to avoid the basic rules. The standard Chinese Rules cover this:

### A. One Check, One Chase (Yi Jiang Yi Zhuo)

You move once to Check the King, and the next move to Chase a piece (e.g., a Chariot or Cannon), repeatedly.

* **Rule:** **Forbidden.** This is considered a "Perpetual Attack." The attacker must change.

### B. One Check, One Kill (Yi Jiang Yi Sha)

You move once to Check, and the next move threatens Checkmate (Mate in 1).

* **Rule:** **Forbidden.** The attacker must change.

### C. One Check, One Idle (Yi Jiang Yi Xian)

You move once to Check, and the next move is a non-attacking, non-threatening move (an "idle" move).

* **Rule:** **Allowed.** If the defender repeats moves to avoid the idle move, it is usually ruled a draw, or the defender must change.

## Summary Table: Who Must Change?

| Situation | Red's Action | Black's Action | Verdict | Action Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Perpetual Check** | Checks repeatedly | Blocks/Moves King | **Red Forbidden** | **Red** must change (or loses). |
| **Perpetual Chase** | Chases **Unprotected** piece | Runs away | **Red Forbidden** | **Red** must change (or loses). |
| **Perpetual Chase** | Chases **Protected** (True Root) | Runs away (avoids trade) | **Red Allowed** | **Black** must change (or Draw). |
| **1 Check, 1 Chase** | Check then Chase | Defends | **Red Forbidden** | **Red** must change. |
| **Mutual Attack** | Check/Chase | Check/Chase | **Mutual Violation** | **Draw** (if neither changes). |

### What this means for you?

If you are playing online (e.g., on an app) and the game stops you from moving:

1. **Check if you are attacking.** If you are the one threatening a piece or the King, the rules almost always force you to stop.
2. **Look for the "Pin".** If you think you are allowed to chase because the enemy is protected, look closely—is their protector pinned? If yes, it's a "False Root," and you must stop chasing.
